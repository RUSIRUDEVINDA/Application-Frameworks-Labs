EXPLANATION: Destructuring.html
==================================

This code demonstrates array destructuring - extracting values from an array and assigning them to separate variables in a concise way.

STEP-BY-STEP BREAKDOWN:
=======================

Step 1: Define a function that returns multiple values
    function calculate(a, b) {
    - This function takes two parameters: a and b
    - It will return multiple calculated results

Step 2: Calculate different operations
    const add = a + b;
    const subtract = a - b;
    const multiply = a * b;
    const divide = a / b;
    - Performs four mathematical operations
    - Stores each result in a separate variable

Step 3: Return results as an array
    return [add, subtract, multiply, divide];
    - Returns an array containing all four results
    - The array elements correspond to: [sum, difference, product, quotient]

Step 4: Call the function and destructure the result
    const [add, subtract, multiply, divide] = calculate(4, 7);
    
    This line does several things:
    
    a) calculate(4, 7) is called
       - a = 4, b = 7
       - Calculates: add=11, subtract=-3, multiply=28, divide=0.571...
       - Returns: [11, -3, 28, 0.571...]
    
    b) [add, subtract, multiply, divide] = ... is DESTRUCTURING
       - Instead of storing the entire array in one variable
       - It splits the array and assigns each element to separate variables
       - add = 11 (first array element)
       - subtract = -3 (second array element)
       - multiply = 28 (third array element)
       - divide = 0.571... (fourth array element)

Step 5: Display the results
    document.write("<p>Sum: " + add + "</p>");
    document.write("<p>Difference " + subtract + "</p>");
    document.write("<p>Product: " + multiply + "</p>");
    document.write("<p>Quotient " + divide + "</p>");
    - Writes each result as a paragraph to the HTML page
    - Uses the individual variables created by destructuring

DETAILED CALCULATION EXAMPLE (with a=4, b=7):
==============================================
    add = 4 + 7 = 11
    subtract = 4 - 7 = -3
    multiply = 4 * 7 = 28
    divide = 4 / 7 = 0.5714285714...

COMPARISON: WITH vs WITHOUT DESTRUCTURING
===========================================

WITHOUT DESTRUCTURING (traditional way):
    const result = calculate(4, 7);
    const add = result[0];        // Access by index [0]
    const subtract = result[1];   // Access by index [1]
    const multiply = result[2];   // Access by index [2]
    const divide = result[3];     // Access by index [3]

WITH DESTRUCTURING (modern way):
    const [add, subtract, multiply, divide] = calculate(4, 7);

Destructuring is cleaner and more readable!

KEY CONCEPTS:
=============
- Array destructuring: Extracting array elements into separate variables
- Destructuring assignment: Assigning array values to specific variable names
- Position matters: First array element → first variable, etc.
- Only needed elements can be extracted
- Can skip elements: const [first, , third] = array; skips second element

EXECUTION STEPS:
================
1. calculate(4, 7) is called
2. Function calculates four operations (11, -3, 28, ~0.571)
3. Function returns the array [11, -3, 28, 0.5714...]
4. Destructuring assignment unpacks the array:
   - add ← 11
   - subtract ← -3
   - multiply ← 28
   - divide ← 0.5714...
5. Each value is now in its own variable
6. document.write() displays each value

OUTPUT:
=======
Sum: 11
Difference -3
Product: 28
Quotient 0.5714285714285714
