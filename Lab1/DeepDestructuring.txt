EXPLANATION: DeepDestructuring.html
=====================================

This code demonstrates nested object destructuring - extracting specific properties from nested objects in a concise way.

STEP-BY-STEP BREAKDOWN:
=======================

Step 1: Create a complex object with nested properties
    const vehicleOne = {
        brand: 'Ford',
        model: 'Mustang',
        type: 'car',
        year: 2021,
        color: 'red',
        registration: {
            city: 'Houston',
            state: 'Texas',
            country: 'USA'
        }
    }
    - vehicleOne is an object with several properties
    - registration is a nested object containing city, state, and country
    - This is a typical complex data structure

Step 2: Call a function with the object
    myVehicle(vehicleOne)
    - Passes the entire vehicleOne object to myVehicle function
    - myVehicle function receives and processes this object

Step 3: Define the function with destructuring parameters
    function myVehicle({ model, registration: { state } })
    
    This line does several things:
    
    a) { model, registration: { state } } is DESTRUCTURING SYNTAX
       - Instead of receiving the whole object and accessing properties manually
       - It extracts specific properties directly in the function parameters
    
    b) model
       - Extracts the 'model' property from the top level of vehicleOne
       - model = 'Mustang'
    
    c) registration: { state }
       - This is the complex part - NESTED DESTRUCTURING
       - registration: { state } means:
         * Look for 'registration' property in the object
         * Inside registration, extract only the 'state' property
       - state = 'Texas' (extracted from registration.state)

Step 4: Use the extracted values
    const message = 'My ' + model + ' is registered in ' + state + '.';
    - Uses the extracted 'model' and 'state' values
    - model = 'Mustang'
    - state = 'Texas'
    - Creates message: 'My Mustang is registered in Texas.'

Step 5: Display the message
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = message;
    - Finds HTML element with id "demo"
    - Inserts the message into that element

COMPARISON: WITH vs WITHOUT DESTRUCTURING
===========================================

WITHOUT DESTRUCTURING (traditional way):
    function myVehicle(vehicle) {
        let model = vehicle.model;
        let state = vehicle.registration.state;
        const message = 'My ' + model + ' is registered in ' + state + '.';
    }

WITH DESTRUCTURING (modern way):
    function myVehicle({ model, registration: { state } }) {
        const message = 'My ' + model + ' is registered in ' + state + '.';
    }

Destructuring is cleaner, more concise, and shows intent clearly.

KEY CONCEPTS:
=============
- Destructuring: Extracting values from objects/arrays into separate variables
- Object destructuring: Extracting object properties
- Nested destructuring: Extracting properties from nested objects
- Parameters destructuring: Using destructuring in function parameters
- Only needed properties are extracted, unnecessary ones are ignored

EXECUTION FLOW:
===============
1. vehicleOne object is created with data
2. myVehicle(vehicleOne) is called
3. Destructuring happens immediately in the function parameters:
   - Extracts model: 'Mustang'
   - Extracts registration.state: 'Texas'
4. Message is created using extracted values
5. Message is displayed in the HTML element

OUTPUT:
=======
My Mustang is registered in Texas.
