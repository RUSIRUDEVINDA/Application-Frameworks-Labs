EXPLANATION: Class.html
==========================

This code demonstrates JavaScript classes, constructors, inheritance (extends), and the 'this' keyword.

STEP-BY-STEP BREAKDOWN:
=======================

Step 1: Define the parent class (Car)
    class Car {
        constructor(name) {
            this.brand = name;
        }
    - Creates a blueprint for a Car object
    - constructor() is called when a new Car is created
    - 'this.brand' stores the name parameter as a property of the object
    - Example: If name="Ford", then this.brand="Ford"

Step 2: Add a method to the Car class
    present() {
        return 'I have a ' + this.brand;
    }
    - Defines a method that uses 'this' to access the object's brand property
    - Returns a string containing the brand

Step 3: Define the child class (Model) that extends Car
    class Model extends Car {
    - Model inherits all properties and methods from Car
    - 'extends' keyword means Model is a subclass of Car

Step 4: Add constructor to Model class
    constructor(name, mod) {
        super(name)
        this.model = mod
    }
    - super(name) calls the parent class (Car) constructor
    - Passes the 'name' to Car's constructor
    - 'this.model = mod' adds a new property specific to Model
    - Example: If mod="Mustang", then this.model="Mustang"

Step 5: Add method to Model class
    show() {
        return this.present() + ', it is a ' + this.model;
    }
    - Calls the inherited method present() from Car
    - Adds additional text including the model property
    - Returns combined string

Step 6: Create an instance and call the method
    const mymodel = new Model("Ford", "Mustang");
    - Creates a new Model object
    - Passes "Ford" as the brand and "Mustang" as the model
    - mymodel.brand = "Ford" (from Car constructor via super)
    - mymodel.model = "Mustang" (from Model constructor)

Step 7: Display the result
    document.write(mymodel.show());
    - Calls the show() method on the mymodel object
    - Displays the result on the web page

EXECUTION FLOW:
===============
1. new Model("Ford", "Mustang") is called
2. Model's constructor runs:
   - super("Ford") calls Car's constructor
   - Car's constructor sets this.brand = "Ford"
   - this.model = "Mustang" is set
3. mymodel.show() is called:
   - Calls this.present() → returns "I have a Ford"
   - Adds ", it is a " + this.model → adds ", it is a Mustang"
   - Returns: "I have a Ford, it is a Mustang"
4. document.write() displays this string

KEY CONCEPTS:
=============
- class: Blueprint for objects
- constructor: Special method that runs when an object is created
- extends: Inheritance - child class gets parent's methods/properties
- super: Calls parent class's constructor
- this: Refers to the current object
- Methods: Functions that belong to an object

OUTPUT:
=======
I have a Ford, it is a Mustang
