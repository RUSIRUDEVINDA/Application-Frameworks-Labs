EXPLANATION: Variables2.html
==============================

This code demonstrates the behavior of 'const' variables and how const prevents reassignment but allows property mutation.

STEP-BY-STEP BREAKDOWN:
=======================

Step 1: Create a const object
    const a = {
        prop1: 10,
        prop2: 9
    }
    
    - Declares variable 'a' using 'const'
    - Assigns an object with two properties
    - prop1 = 10
    - prop2 = 9
    - 'const' means the variable itself cannot be reassigned
    - However, the object's contents can be modified

Step 2: Modify a property of the const object
    a.prop1 = 3
    
    What happens:
    - This line MODIFIES the object's property
    - It doesn't reassign the 'a' variable itself
    - So this is ALLOWED with const
    - After this: a = {prop1: 3, prop2: 9}
    - Note: Memory address of object 'a' stays the same
    - We're just changing what's inside the object

    // It is allowed - comment confirms this works

Step 3: Try to reassign the const variable
    const b = {
        b: 10,
        prop2: 9
    }
    
    What happens:
    - Declares a new const object 'b'
    - Assigns properties to it
    - But there's nothing after this to show the problem...
    - However, if you tried something like:
    
    b = { new: 'object' }
    
    This would cause an error:
    "TypeError: Assignment to constant variable."
    
    // It is not allowed - comment explains reassignment is not permitted

CONST BEHAVIOR COMPARISON:
==========================

MODIFYING PROPERTIES (ALLOWED):
    const obj = {x: 1, y: 2};
    obj.x = 5;           // ✓ ALLOWED - modify property
    obj.z = 3;           // ✓ ALLOWED - add new property
    obj['x'] = 10;       // ✓ ALLOWED - modify with bracket notation
    Result: obj = {x: 10, y: 2, z: 3}

REASSIGNING VARIABLE (NOT ALLOWED):
    const obj = {x: 1, y: 2};
    obj = {x: 5};        // ✗ ERROR - cannot reassign
    obj = null;          // ✗ ERROR - cannot reassign
    obj = obj;           // ✗ ERROR - cannot reassign

CONST VS LET VS VAR:
====================

CONST:
    - Block-scoped
    - Cannot be reassigned
    - Cannot be redeclared
    - Must be initialized
    - Object/Array contents CAN be modified
    - Preferred for values that don't change reference

LET:
    - Block-scoped
    - CAN be reassigned
    - Cannot be redeclared
    - Can be declared without initialization
    - Use when variable will change

VAR:
    - Function-scoped
    - CAN be reassigned
    - CAN be redeclared
    - Hoisted and initialized
    - Avoid in modern JavaScript

MEMORY CONCEPT:
===============
When you do:
    const a = {prop1: 10, prop2: 9};

JavaScript stores:
    Variable name 'a' → Points to Memory Address #5000
    Memory Address #5000 → Contains {prop1: 10, prop2: 9}

When you do:
    a.prop1 = 3;

JavaScript:
    Variable name 'a' → Still points to Memory Address #5000
    Memory Address #5000 → Now contains {prop1: 3, prop2: 9}
    
The memory address doesn't change, just the data at that address.

If you try:
    a = {new: 'object'};

JavaScript would need to:
    Variable name 'a' → Point to Memory Address #5001
    
But const prevents this - can't change what 'a' points to!

WHY USE CONST?
==============
- Prevents accidental reassignment
- Makes intent clear: "This variable's reference won't change"
- Safer default - most variables don't need reassignment
- Helps catch bugs - get error if you accidentally reassign
- Better for objects/arrays that will have content modified

MODERN BEST PRACTICES:
======================
1. Use const by default
2. Use let only if reassignment is needed
3. Avoid var entirely in modern code

EXECUTION FLOW:
===============
1. const a = {...} creates object 'a' in memory
2. a.prop1 = 3 modifies the object's property
3. a.prop1 is now 3 instead of 10
4. const b = {...} creates object 'b'
5. If code tried to reassign a or b, it would throw an error

KEY CONCEPTS:
=============
- const: Prevents variable reassignment
- Mutation: Changing object/array contents (allowed with const)
- Reassignment: Changing what variable points to (not allowed with const)
- Reference: Memory location of an object
- Block scope: Accessible within { } block
- Immutability: Cannot change (for the variable reference itself)

EXAMPLES OF WHAT FAILS WITH CONST:
===================================
const arr = [1, 2, 3];

arr.push(4);           // ✓ WORKS - modifying array
arr[0] = 99;           // ✓ WORKS - modifying array element
arr = [5, 6, 7];       // ✗ ERROR - reassigning array variable
arr = null;            // ✗ ERROR - reassigning array variable

const str = "hello";
str = "goodbye";       // ✗ ERROR - cannot reassign

WHY THIS MATTERS:
=================
This code demonstrates why understanding const is important:
- Common misconception: "const = cannot change"
- Reality: "const = cannot change what variable refers to"
- You CAN change the contents of a const object/array
- You CANNOT change what the variable points to
- This distinction is crucial for JavaScript development
