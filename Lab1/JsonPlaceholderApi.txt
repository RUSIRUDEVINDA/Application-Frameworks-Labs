EXPLANATION: JsonPlaceholderApi.html
======================================

This code demonstrates using the Fetch API to make HTTP requests and working with JSON data from an API.

STEP-BY-STEP BREAKDOWN:
=======================

Step 1: Understand what an API is
    API = Application Programming Interface
    - A way for applications to communicate with each other
    - Allows you to request data from a server
    - JSON Placeholder is a free fake API for testing
    - URL: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/

Step 2: Make a fetch request
    fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1')
    - fetch() makes an HTTP GET request to the specified URL
    - URL: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1
    - Requests the first "todo" item from the fake API
    - fetch() returns a Promise (asynchronous operation)
    - The request is sent to the server and we wait for a response

Step 3: Handle the response
    .then(response => response.json())
    
    After the server responds:
    - .then() waits for the response to arrive
    - response => is an arrow function that receives the response
    - response.json() converts the response from JSON text format into a JavaScript object
    - This step parses the raw data into usable format
    - Returns another Promise containing the parsed data

Step 4: Process the data
    .then(json => console.log(json))
    
    After the JSON is parsed:
    - .then() receives the parsed data
    - json => is an arrow function that receives the data object
    - console.log(json) outputs the data to the browser console
    - You can view this by pressing F12 and opening the console tab

WHAT DATA YOU GET:
===================
The API returns something like:
{
  "userId": 1,
  "id": 1,
  "title": "delectus aut autem",
  "completed": false
}

This is JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format - a standard way to represent data.

PROMISE CHAIN EXPLANATION:
==========================
fetch() returns a Promise
    ↓
Promise resolves with response object
    ↓
.then(response => response.json())
    ↓
json() converts response to JavaScript object (returns another Promise)
    ↓
Promise resolves with the actual data
    ↓
.then(json => console.log(json))
    ↓
Logs the data to console

WHAT IS FETCH?
==============
fetch() is a modern JavaScript function for making HTTP requests
- Replaces older XMLHttpRequest method
- Built into modern browsers
- Returns a Promise (doesn't block/wait, allows other code to run)
- Can be used for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests
- Handles both success and error responses

WHY USE ASYNC (PROMISES)?
==========================
- Making network requests takes time
- Synchronous (waiting) would freeze the page
- Asynchronous (Promises) allows the page to remain responsive
- Other code can continue running while request is in progress
- When response arrives, the .then() callback is executed

ERROR HANDLING (OPTIONAL):
==========================
To handle errors, you could add:
    .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error))

This catches any network errors or issues with the request.

KEY CONCEPTS:
=============
- API: Service that provides data
- Fetch: Browser function for making HTTP requests
- Promise: Object representing asynchronous operation
- JSON: Text format for data (becomes JavaScript object when parsed)
- .then(): Waits for Promise to resolve, runs callback function
- Arrow function (=>): Concise function syntax used in Promises

URL BREAKDOWN:
==============
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1
- https: Secure protocol
- jsonplaceholder.typicode.com: Domain name (API service)
- /todos: Resource type (we want todos)
- /1: Specific todo with ID 1

JSON PLACEHOLDER ENDPOINTS:
===========================
/posts - Fake blog posts
/comments - Fake comments
/albums - Fake albums
/photos - Fake photos
/todos - Fake todo items
/users - Fake users

CONSOLE OUTPUT (Example):
=========================
{
  userId: 1,
  id: 1,
  title: "delectus aut autem",
  completed: false
}

(Visible in browser console - press F12)
