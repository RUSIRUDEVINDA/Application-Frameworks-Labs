## Issues with the Code

There are **no critical issues** - this code will run successfully! However, there's one minor point:
- The `<p id="demo"></p>` element isn't being used. The output goes to the browser console, not the webpage.

## How to Run This Code

**Method 1: Save and Open in Browser**
1. Copy the code into a text editor (Notepad, VS Code, etc.)
2. Save it as `test.html`
3. Double-click the file to open it in your browser
4. Press `F12` (or right-click → "Inspect") to open Developer Tools
5. Click the "Console" tab to see the output

**Method 2: Quick Test in Browser**
1. Open any browser
2. Press `F12` to open Developer Tools
3. Go to the "Console" tab
4. Paste just the JavaScript part (everything between `<script>` tags)
5. Press Enter

## Beginner-Level Explanation

This code demonstrates **prototypal inheritance** in JavaScript - a way for objects to share properties and methods.

### Breaking It Down:

**1. Creating a Template Object**
```javascript
const Animal = {
    type: "Invertebrates",
    displayType() {
        console.log(this.type)
    }
}
```
Think of `Animal` as a blueprint. It has a `type` property and a `displayType` method that prints the type.

**2. Creating animal1**
```javascript
const animal1 = Object.create(Animal)
animal1.displayType()  // Outputs: "Invertebrates"
```
- `Object.create(Animal)` creates a new object that "inherits" from `Animal`
- `animal1` doesn't have its own `type` property, so it looks up to its "parent" (`Animal`) and finds `"Invertebrates"`

**3. Creating fish**
```javascript
const fish = Object.create(Animal)
fish.type = "Fishes"
fish.displayType()  // Outputs: "Fishes"
```
- `fish` also inherits from `Animal`
- But we give `fish` its **own** `type` property with value `"Fishes"`
- Now when `displayType()` runs, it finds `fish`'s own `type` first, so it prints `"Fishes"`

### The Key Concept:
When you look for a property on an object, JavaScript first checks the object itself. If it doesn't find it there, it looks at the "parent" object (the prototype). This is called the **prototype chain**.

**Output you'll see in console:**
```
Invertebrates
Fishes
```
